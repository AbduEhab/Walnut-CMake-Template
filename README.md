# Cmake-Template Repo

This Repo is for those who want to use `The Cherno`'s library but would rather use good old CMake (with maybe VS Code) than the full fat version of Visual Studio that he set up the project to use. I'm looking into Linux compatibility.

# Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- x64 Compiler (DOES NOT WORK WITH x86 COMPILERS!!!) (Currently tested `only` with [Visual Studio 17 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)
